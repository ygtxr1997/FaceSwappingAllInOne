# MegaFS PyTorch Inference Code

Implementation of [**One Shot Face Swapping on Megapixels**](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04932) in PyTorch

## Requirements

- Please refer [stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) to get StyleGAN2 environment (converted model is provided in this repo)
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch 1.5.1 (it is ok that  [stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) uses 1.3.1)
- CUDA 10.1/10.2

## Usage

### Dataset

Please download [CelebA-HQ](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans#preparing-datasets-for-training) and [CelebAMask-HQ](https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ).

Also, please note the mask label is assigned as

  | label list      |             |             |
  | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | 0: 'background' | 1: 'skin'   | 2: 'l_brow' |
  | 3: 'r_brow'     | 4: 'l_eye'  | 5: 'r_eye'  |
  | 6: 'eye_g'      | 7: 'l_ear'  | 8: 'r_ear'  |
  | 9: 'ear_r'      | 10: 'nose'  | 11: 'mouth' |
  | 12: 'u_lip'     | 13: 'l_lip' | 14: 'neck'  |
  | 15: 'neck_l'    | 16: 'cloth' | 17: 'hair'  |
  | 18: 'hat'       |             |             |
  
in case of updated CelebAMask-HQ dataset.

### Inference
Put two provided files under *stylegan2-pytorch* directory, then run:

> python inference.py \
> 
> --swap_type [ftm/injection/lcr] \
> 
> --img_root [CelebAHQ-PATH] \
> 
> --mask_root [CelebAMaskHQ-PATH] \
> 
> --srcID [INT-NUMBER] \
> 
> --tgtID [INT-NUMBER]

The result is rearrange as *source_image, target_image, swapped_face, refined_swapped_face*, where  *refined_swapped_face* is the reconstructed version of *swapped_face*. Please refer more details in the provided codes.
